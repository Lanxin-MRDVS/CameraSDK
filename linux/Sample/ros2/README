// How to building and use lx_camera_node node
// Test on ubuntu22.04(humble)
// Since camera SDK conflicts with ROS2 FastDDS, dynamic link method cloud be used to slove this problem 
// Visual localization module is used for camera V1Pro, please read README_Localization(ROS2).pdf if you use this module
// In ROS2 package, you should not change launch file in folder "src" but not "install"
step 0: cd lx_camera_node_ws
step 1: colcon build
step 2: source install/setup.bash
Step 3: ros2 launch lx_camera_ros lx_camera_ros.launch.py

Note: If, when running a ROS2 program, the subscription topic has a frame rate that is too low, it may be due to improper configuration of the device's DDS policy. You can change it to cyclonedds. The specific steps are as follows:
step 0：sudo apt update
step 1：sudo apt install ros-<Your ROS2 version>-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp ，For example, if it is the humble system, then use:sudo apt install ros-humble-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp
step 2：cd lx_camera_node_ws
step 3: source install/setup.bash
step 4：export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp
Step 5: ros2 launch lx_camera_ros lx_camera_ros.launch.py
